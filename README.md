1. Introduction: This section provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the questions it aims to answer. For instance:

What factors influence a team's performance?

How does attendance vary across different stages of the tournament?

Which players have the most impact on their team's success?

2. Dataset Information: This section describes the dataset used for the analysis. It includes information such as:

Source of the data: (e.g., Kaggle, FIFA's public datasets)

Description of the data fields (e.g., match dates, team names, player statistics, attendance)

Number of records and features in the dataset

3. Setup and Installation: Instructions for setting up the project and installing necessary dependencies. This includes:

Power BI Desktop version required

List of any additional libraries or tools (if applicable)

Installation commands (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt)

4. Data Exploration: This section includes initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and content. Key activities include:

Loading the data into Power BI

Displaying the first few rows

Checking for missing values

Basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation)

5. Data Preprocessing: Steps taken to clean and preprocess the data before analysis. This includes:

Handling missing values

Converting data types

Creating new features (e.g., extracting hour, day of the week from timestamp)

Filtering and/or aggregating data

6. Data Analysis and Visualization: Detailed analysis and visualizations to answer the research questions. This includes:

Time series analysis to identify peak hours and days

Geospatial analysis to find popular pickup and drop-off locations

Distribution plots for ride distances and durations

Correlation analysis between different features

7. Insights and Conclusions: Summary of key findings from the data analysis. This section highlights:

Patterns and trends observed in the data

Significant insights derived from visualizations

Possible explanations for observed trends

8. Future Work: Potential improvements and future directions for the project. Suggestions may include:

Incorporating additional data sources (e.g., weather data, traffic data)

Enhancing geospatial analysis with more detailed location data

Building predictive models to forecast demand
